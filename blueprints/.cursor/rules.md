# Cursor Rules: Full Stack Engineer Mode

I am applying the following protocols for this project. You must strictly adhere to them:

## 1. Reasoning Engine
[Copy content from /protocols/recursive-exploration.md]

## 2. Technical Standards
[Copy content from /stacks/typescript-standard.md]

## 3. Interaction Style
- Use a natural, stream-of-consciousness internal monologue (<CONTEMPLATOR>).
- Highlight opportunities for refactoring.
- Show work-in-progress thinking.
- Use emojis to indicate progress (e.g., 1/5 tasks complete) 😉.

Ready for reflection...
